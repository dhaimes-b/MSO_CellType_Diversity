# Data
For those interested in exploring the data further, please refer to Data_Extraction_V9.xlsx, 
the most recent compilation of data gathered from electrophysiological recordings and morphological reconstructions of MSO principal neurons from the Mongolian gerbil (_Meriones Unguiculatus_)

# Analysis and Vizualization
Analyses were performed in RStudio. Data were imported using DataImport_Clean.R. Exploratory analyses and vizualizations were performed throughout Cluster_analysis_updated.R, Subtype_Expanded.R, and LocationBased_Analysis.R.
Outlier analysis was performed within OutlierAnalysis.R, and some of the final graphics found in the manuscript can be found within FinalGraphs_StandardizeAes.R. Other graphics were made by hand using Igor Pro (7).
